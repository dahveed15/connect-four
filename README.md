# Connect Four

Connect Four is a two-player game made in React where players compete to see who can get four consecutive circles in a row, column, or diagonal.

Whoever achieves this goal first wins! If the board is filled with no one accomplishing this goal, the game is over.

To play, simply clone or download this repo, run "npm start" in the terminal (or type npm install first if you don't have npm), and you should be good to go.
